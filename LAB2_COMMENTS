Client
Spec says connectionClosed should shut down client. Reasonable to not do this, since client could try to connect to a different server.

getport, get host, setport are good

-2 in setHost, no need for doCommand! X

-3 logoff: no need for ServerLogoffHandler - this can be done in server-side clientException method.  Why gethost in catch clause?? X

Server
-3 in handleMessageFromClient no need to check isClosed — cannot be called when server is closed. X

-3 in HandleMessage - no check needed and no message “server is closed” In fact this prevents the server-user from resetting the port then reopening the server with start X

-2 in start should be no call to handleMesssageFromUser — just use display! X

-3 Server should have ChatIF, not ServerConsole, so a GUI could be added later X

serverStopped is only for appropriate messages (or to set closed) - it is called when stopListening happens, so should not call stopListening

No need for EchoServer main - it is started by the ServerConsole
-3 ServerConsole should pass itself to the EchoServer constructor, which should take a ChatIF parameter X

getport, setport good

-2 start and stop should not have messages, these should be in serverStarted and serverStopped hook methods. X

-3 close and quit  must stop listening and close port, using server close method. Should not call handleMessageFromUser 

-3 did no override AbstractServer methods clientException as indicated in E49. X
